we could make a generic type systemn for messages?

add type hints, document the code better

how are users structured?

type hints in python yes

tuple use?

documetnation for the user

documentaiton for the programmer

what if the messages were verbs insted of nouns?

entities.py's parsedCmd's class -> verb thing is a juncture we can change
